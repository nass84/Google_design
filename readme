# Google Challenge

## Overview

This was our **First** Wednesday session at School of code. The challenge that was set was using pair programming, take it in turns to create the google webpage design. 

## Outcome

Unfortunately Saras internet kept cutting out so we weren't able to do much pair programming. I continued after class to work on my own version. 

### Highlights
- Figuring out how to make the links not have a line underneath them unless you hover overthem
- Using Stack to find solutions to get space between the buttons. 

### Still to do
- Figure out why the images arent in the center
- Try and seperate the links on the top to put space between them.
