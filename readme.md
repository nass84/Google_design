## Outcome  

Unfortunately my partners internet kept cutting out so we weren't able to do much pair programming. I continued after class to work on my own version.   

### Highlights
* Figuring out how to make the links not have a line underneath them unless you hover overthem  
* Using Stack to find solutions to get space between the buttons.   

### Still to do
- [ ] Check if my solution for the hover link was accurate  
> text-decoration-line: initial  
- [ ] Figure out why the images arent in the center  
- [ ] Try and seperate the links on the top to put space between them.
